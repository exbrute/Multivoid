// coop/interactables/floppy_slot_sync.h -- a disc-holding device's slot as shared state.
//
// A signal server's slot was on no wire, and that is what loses discs: the insert moves the disc
// into four fields of one AserverBox_C and destroys the actor, the destroy is relayed, and the
// state that replaced the disc exists on one peer. The other peer's box then answers an eject
// with "No floppy disc in the slot", and since a joiner loads the host's save file, which coop
// stops the game refreshing, a rejoin makes the loss permanent.
//
// So the slot is state, the host owns it, and a peer reports the outcome of a slot its own game
// changed. That is MTA's shape for an entity entering a container: the slot states are the
// server's, ship with the entity, and a client's transfer is a request the server answers
// (reference/mtasa-blue/Server/mods/deathmatch/logic/CGame.cpp, VEHICLE_REQUEST_IN). We diverge
// on one point: insertFloppy and ejectFloppy dispatch as EX_LocalVirtualFunction and no seam of
// ours can cancel one, so the claim carries an outcome rather than asking, and the host's
// canonical is the answer a client applies over its own optimistic copy.
